/*
Filename: sophisticated_code.js

This code implements a complex and sophisticated web application that simulates a virtual city. It demonstrates advanced JavaScript concepts such as object-oriented programming, closures, event handling, and asynchronous operations.

Note: The code provided here is a simplified example for demonstration purposes. A real-world virtual city simulation would involve many more components and complexity.

// Object representing a building in the virtual city
class Building {
  constructor(name, location, height) {
    this.name = name;
    this.location = location;
    this.height = height;
  }

  getInfo() {
    return `The ${this.name} is located at ${this.location} and has a height of ${this.height} meters.`;
  }
}

// Object representing a citizen in the virtual city
class Citizen {
  constructor(name, age, occupation) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.occupation = occupation;
  }

  greet() {
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old. I work as a ${this.occupation}.`;
  }
}

// Create some buildings
const building1 = new Building("Skyscraper", "Downtown", 100);
const building2 = new Building("Residential Complex", "Suburbs", 50);
const building3 = new Building("Shopping Mall", "City Center", 80);

// Create some citizens
const citizen1 = new Citizen("John Doe", 30, "Software Engineer");
const citizen2 = new Citizen("Jane Smith", 25, "Teacher");
const citizen3 = new Citizen("Michael Johnson", 45, "Doctor");

// Output information about buildings and citizens
console.log(building1.getInfo());
console.log(building2.getInfo());
console.log(building3.getInfo());

console.log(citizen1.greet());
console.log(citizen2.greet());
console.log(citizen3.greet());

// Event handling example
document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
  console.log("Button clicked!");
});

// Asynchronous operation example
function simulateAsyncOperation() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("Async operation completed!");
    }, 2000);
  });
}

async function performAsyncOperation() {
  const result = await simulateAsyncOperation();
  console.log(result);
}

performAsyncOperation();
